In the most abstract sense, this package deals with

1. Attaching timestamped review information to headlines
2. Querying all headings where reviews are due
3. Reviewing due *positions* of headings

While the primary application is learning information using spaced
repetition, at the end, the API should be flexible enough to implement
other kinds of repeating tasks where it is necessary to store data in
addition to the next date.

Some ideas are collected in the [[file:incubator.org][Incubator]].
