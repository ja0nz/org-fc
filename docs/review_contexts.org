#+TITLE: Review Contexts
#+DATE: [2020-08-01 Sat 10:41]
#+KEYWORDS: fc

By default, two contexts are defined:

- all :: all cards in ~org-fc-directories~
- buffer :: all cards in the current buffer

New contexts can be defined by adding them to the alist
~org-fc-custom-contexts~.

Contexts have the form ~(:paths paths :filter filter)~.

- ~:paths~ (optional)
  either a list of paths, a single path
  or ~'buffer~ for the current buffer.
  Paths don't have to be included in the ~org-fc-directories~.
  Defaults to ~org-fc-directories~.
- ~:filter~ (optional), a card filter defaulting to a filter that
  matches all cards.

Filters can be combinations of the following expressions:

- ~(and ex1 ex2 ...)~
- ~(or ex1 ex2 ...)~
- ~(not ex)~
- ~(tag "tag")~
- ~(type card-type) or (type "card-type")~

* Examples
All double cards with tag "math":
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-fc-custom-contexts
    '(double-math-cards . (:filter (and (type double) (tag "math")))))
#+end_src

All cards in that don't have one of the tags "foo" and "bar":
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-fc-custom-contexts
    '(no-foo-bar-cards . (:filter (not (or (tag "foo") (tag "bar"))))))
#+end_src

All cards in =~/combinatorics/= or =~/number_theory.org=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-fc-custom-contexts
    '(math-cards . (:paths ("~/combinatorics/" "~/number_theory.org"))))
#+end_src

All cards in =~/combinatorics/= with tag "theorem":
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-fc-custom-contexts
    '(combinatorics-theorems .
      (:paths "~/combinatorics/" :filter (tag "theorem"))))
#+end_src

All double cards in the current buffer:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-fc-custom-contexts
    '(current-double .
      (:paths buffer :filter (type double))))
#+end_src
* Note
Because parsing of tags is done in AWK, tag filters don't work for
tags defined in the =#+FILETAGS:= of a =#+SETUP_FILE:=.
