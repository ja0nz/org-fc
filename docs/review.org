A review session can be started with ~M-x org-fc-review~.  Due cards
are reviewed in random order.

If a card was rated "again", it will be reviewed again at the end of
the current review session.  This can be disabled by setting
~org-fc-append-failed-cards~ to ~nil~.

[[file:review_contexts.org][Review Contexts]] can be used to only review cards of a set tag or type,
e.g. when using org-fc to learn different foreign languages where
mixing them in one review session would lead to confusion.

Each time a card is rated, an entry is added to the [[file:review_histord.org][Review History]].

Cards can be excluded from review without deleting them
by [[file:suspending_cards.org][suspending them]].

* Review Process

2. Narrow to heading
3. Set up card for review
4. Activate ~org-fc-flip-mode~
5. Flip the card (user)

8. Repeat process with next due card
