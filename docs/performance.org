All user-facing commands (especially during review) should be as fast
as possible (<300ms).

Using the =awk= indexer, searching 2500 org files (~200k lines in
total) for due flashcards takes around ~500ms on my laptop (Thinkpad
L470, SSD).

Using a lisp indexer based on ~org-map-entries~,
searching a single 6500 line file with 333 flashcards takes ~1000ms,
indexing the same file with =awk= takes around ~50ms.
