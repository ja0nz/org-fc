This is an interactive introduction into org-fc,
using org-fc.

You're currently (re)viewing the front of a flashcard.
To "flip" it, revealing the contents of its "Back" heading,
press the enter key.

You can quit the review at any time by pressing "q".
** Back
This is the back side of the flashcard.

You can now rate how well you remembered the information on the back
side of the card.
